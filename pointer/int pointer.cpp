Indirection or Dereferencing Operator (*)

int number = 88;
int * pNumber = &number;  // Declare and assign the address of variable number to pointer pNumber (0x22ccec)
cout << pNumber<< endl;   // Print the content of the pointer variable, which contain an address (0x22ccec)
cout << *pNumber << endl; // Print the value "pointed to" by the pointer, which is an int (88)
*pNumber = 99;            // Assign a value to where the pointer is pointed to, NOT to the pointer variable
cout << *pNumber << endl; // Print the new value "pointed to" by the pointer (99)
cout << number << endl;   // The value of variable number changes as well (99)

The indirection operator (*) can be used in both the RHS (temp = *pNumber) and the LHS (*pNumber = 99) of an assignment statement.




int * iPtr = 0;         // Declare an int pointer, and initialize the pointer to point to nothing
cout << *iPtr << endl;  // ERROR! STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION exception
 
int * p = NULL;         // Also declare a NULL pointer points to nothing
