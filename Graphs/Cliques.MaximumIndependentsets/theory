Geting the basics clear first:

Independent set:

A set of nodes in graph such that there is no edge in between any two nodes in the set.


Clique:

A set of nodes in graph such that there is a edge in between any two nodes in the set.



Maximal independent set:

A set of nodes in graph which is an independent set, and addition of any other node in the set will lead to breaking of maximal independent set.





Maximal Clique:

A set of nodes in graph which is an clique,and addition of any other node in the set will lead to breaking of maximal cliques


There can be multiple maximal cliques, and maximal independent sets.


Maximum Independent set:
largest maximal independent set.

Maximum Clique: (NP Complete)
largest maximal clique




Cliques and  independent set relation :


Take a graph and its complement
, a maximal independent set in a graph is a maximal clique in it's complement.
